```
### Description: 
```
1. Main features extraction:
This step is for boosting accuracy in classification algorithms. We finally choose ten main features to do prediction.

2. Do prediction: 
Use ten main features provided by a person, we can use Gradient-Boosted Tree model to predict the gender accurately.
